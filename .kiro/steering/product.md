# Product Overview

FutureProof is a decentralized time-capsule application that enables users to create time-locked audio/video messages using client-side encryption, IPFS storage, and Polkadot blockchain.

## Core Value Proposition

**"Guaranteed by math, not corporations"** - Privacy and unlock conditions are enforced by cryptography and blockchain consensus, not trusted third parties.

## Key Features

- Client-side encryption with AES-256-GCM (all encryption/decryption happens in browser)
- Decentralized storage via IPFS (Web3.Storage)
- Blockchain-enforced unlock conditions on Polkadot Westend testnet
- Record or upload audio/video messages
- Time-locked message delivery
- Talisman wallet integration for blockchain interactions

## Privacy Guarantees

- No plaintext media or keys ever leave the user's device
- All encryption/decryption operations are client-side only
- Unlock conditions enforced by blockchain consensus
- Decentralized storage with no central authority
